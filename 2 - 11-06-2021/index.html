<h5> Trent Boult - 4 Wcikets </h5>
<h6> James Anderson </h6>

<p> <b> 50.6 </b> Anderson to Will Young, no run, 134kph, outswinger, off-stump line, Young gets squared up but does well to play with soft hands.  
The ball catches the outside edge and rolls towards the cordon </p><br>
<p> <b> 50.5 </b> Anderson to Will Young, FOUR, glorious stroke! Anderson gets the ball to swing away as he bowls full but Young is well equipped to put it away. He allows the ball to curl away and holds his poise as he beautifully drives through the covers. Off the meat of the bat </p><br>
<p> <b> 50.4 </b> Anderson to Will Young, no run, 132kph, back to the outswinger, left alone outside off </p><br>
<p> <b> 50.3 </b> Anderson to Will Young, no run, 138kph, inswinger, on a fuller length and that's been blunted towards mid-wicket </p><br>
<p> <b> 50.2 </b> Anderson to Will Young, no run, 132kph, another outswinger, another leave from Young </p><br>
<p> <b> 50.1 </b> Anderson to Will Young, no run, full ball, good shape away from the right-hander outside off, Young lifts his bat and lets it go </p><br>
